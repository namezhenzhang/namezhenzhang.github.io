# About me

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at UC Santa Barbara, fortunate to be advised by Professor [Xin Eric Wang](https://eric-xw.github.io/).

Previously, I was a member of [THUNLP](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/) supervised by [Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/). In the summer of 2022, I conducted research under Professor [Xin Eric Wang](https://eric-xw.github.io/) at UCSC.
