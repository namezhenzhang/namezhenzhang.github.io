# About me

I am a senior student from the Department of Physics, Tsinghua University. 
I am a member of THUNLP supervised by Zhiyuan Liu. In the summer of 2022, I conducted research under Professor [Xin Wang](https://eric-xw.github.io/) at UCSC.

# Research
My research interests lie within the pre-trained language models, parameter-efficient tuning, vision and language, etc.
