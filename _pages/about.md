# About me

I am a 1st-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science, UC Santa Barbara. My advisor is Prof. Shiyu Chang and I also work closely with Prof. Yang Zhang. My research interest mainly lies in natural language processing and machine learning.

Previously, I was a member of [THUNLP](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/) supervised by [Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/). In the summer of 2022, I conducted research under Professor [Xin Eric Wang](https://eric-xw.github.io/) at UCSC.

# Research
My research interests lie within the pre-trained language models, parameter-efficient tuning, machine learning, robustness, etc.
