# About me

I am a senior student from the Department of Physics, Tsinghua University. 
I am a member of [THUNLP](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/) supervised by [Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/). In the summer of 2022, I conducted research under Professor [Xin Wang](https://eric-xw.github.io/) at UCSC.


Recently, Iâ€™m applying for Ph.D. programs.

# Research
My research interests lie within the pre-trained language models, parameter-efficient tuning, vision and language, etc.
